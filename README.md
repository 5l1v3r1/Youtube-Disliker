# Youtube-Disliker
Dislike all of somebody's youtube videos. You can also comment something on each of their videos. This was just made for fun and not to inflict any harm on anyone :)


Libraries used: Selenium 

HOW TO USE:

1. Increase/decrease the range of window scrolling depending on how many videos they have
2. Open up the python script, enter your email and password for youtube in the specified area
3. Enter an optional comment in the area specified if you wish to leave one under their videos
